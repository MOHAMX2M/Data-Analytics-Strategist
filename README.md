Data Analytics Strategist Project â€“ Customer Churn & Retail Analytics

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics lifecycle, covering strategy, data acquisition, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and stakeholder reporting. The case study focuses on retail analytics and customer churn prediction, leveraging Python-based tools for practical, business-driven insights.

Week 1: Designed a strategic analytics framework for retail sales and customer behavior, highlighting demand forecasting, segmentation, and inventory optimization.

Week 2: Developed a data acquisition and preprocessing strategy, handling multiple sources (CSV, APIs, SQL) with robust cleaning, transformation, and risk mitigation steps.

Week 3: Built an EDA and visualization plan to uncover churn drivers, customer demographics, and usage behavior using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Week 4: Outlined a predictive modeling strategy using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with evaluation via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Week 5: Compiled results into a strategic reporting and dashboard plan with Plotly and Dash for interactive insights, stakeholder storytelling, and actionable recommendations.

The project emphasizes strategic design + technical implementation, bridging the gap between data science and business decision-making. It showcases how Python, visualization, and machine learning can drive customer retention strategies, improve forecasting, and optimize retail operations.
